# Rusty Sorth

An experimental implementation of the Strange Forth language in Rust.  Like the C++ version, this
version byte-code compiles the source and runs the byte-code in a simple VM.

This version isn't up to full feature parity with the original but a slightly modified standard
library and fancy repl do work in this version.

Currently missing from the C++ version is the threading support and parity with the FFI interface.
